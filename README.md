## CASH REGISTER/RETAIL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 

## OVERVIEW
This project is a command-line based cash register system developed for a master's project. It allows for the management of customer orders, product listings, and member discounts within a retail context. Designed to run as a standalone Python script, it emphasizes a functional programming style.

## FEATURES
- Place orders for multiple products.
- Add or update product information.
- View a list of all customers and members.
- Apply discounts for members.
- Generate and display order receipts.

## REQUIREMENTS
Python 3.x. No external libraries are required except for sys, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of systems.

## SETUP + EXECUTION
1. Download the cash_register.py file to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing cash_register.py.
4. Execute the script using Python by running: python cash_register.py.
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the system.

## USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
